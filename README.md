This is the repository for roblytlepolitical.science

built using [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [`hugo-academic`](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic).

Keeping this repo public for both the all-powerful Google crawler, and so that other `hugo-academic` users can see the settings/customizations done to the site. For example, [`this script`](https://github.com/RobLytle/roblytlepolitical.science/blob/master/assets/scss/custom.scss), which allows dynamic primary color changing in when toggling light/dark mode.
