I hold an M.S. in political science from Florida State University. Since earning my degree I have worked in the nonprofit sector, and as a freelance statistician, policy analyst, and web designer. 

This is a personal blog. Any views or opinions expressed here belong solely to me and do not represent those of the people, institutions, and organizations with whom I may be associated.
