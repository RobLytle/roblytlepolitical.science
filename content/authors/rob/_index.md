I'm earning my doctorate in political science at Florida State University studying polarization, anti-establishment politics, and the affective divisions within parties. 

This site is currently under construction. Going forward, I'll keep it up to date with project updates and [blog posts](post). If you're interested in what I'm working on right now, feel free to follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/RobLytle), where I host my in-progress research.
