Political scientists are uncharacteristically eager to problematize polarization and insinuate bold action to ameliorate—or at least avoid amplifying—polarization. In this essay, I argue two related points. First, that ideological extremity and ideological consistency are not synonymous, nor even necessarily correlated. Second, scholars should consider the popularity of the polarization subfield relative to others when proposing and evaluating interventions. It is not necessarily that polarization is a uniquely concerning phenomenon, it may simply be that more people write articles about (and thus have found more concerns regarding) polarization. Scholars of polarization should carefully consider the potential downsides of anti-polarization interventions.\nTwo oft-discussed effects of elite polarization include declining legislative productivity and a concomitant decline in the public’s trust in government. Researchers and pundits often propose reforms intended to advantage moderates (often malapropistically referenced as “non-ideological”) candidates over extreme (“ideological” candidates). Such a characterization fundamentally misrepresents what it means to be “ideological”. Breadth—the number of issue areas encompassed by a belief system—and constraint, the correlation between positions related to area i and area j are the defining characteristics of ideology. The extremity of a belief system is incidental as to whether the system constitutes an ideology.\nA definition of ideology which includes “extremity” as a necessary condition for “ideology” would be over-complicated, and normatively troubling. Practically, such a definition would make generalizable comparisons of ideology nearly impossible, as extremity is a wholly context dependent descriptor. Belief systems’ status as “ideologies” would vary election to election and time to time; while nothing of value would be gained over an extremity-naïve conception of ideology. Defining ideology on the basis of extremity would describe the mainstream of political opinion at any given time not only as the most popular strain of thought, but as the default political position—rhetorically divorced from the unsavory domains of dishonest ideologues to its left and right. Ideas from outside the status-quo are de-legitimized—not through critique of their programmatic content but by a semantic sleight of hand.\nFigure 1\rSuch is the political world created by sloppy application of words like “ideology” and “moderation”. These words are not antonyms. Rather, “ideology” is a noun and “moderation” an adjective which can sometimes be used to describe an ideology! Pointing this out is not (only) pedantry, but has important implications for the way polarization is (or should be) addressed. Figure 1 represents the distributions of three legislators’ issue preferences along a one-dimensional left-right scale. The mean of distributions \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are -1, 0, and 1 respectively. Each distribution describes an ideology: one left, one right, one between. Though centrist, candidate \\(B\\)’s belief system is precisely as constrained as \\(A\\) or \\(C\\)—the standard deviation of each distribution is .1.\nAssume polarization causes gridlock because the distributions of polarized legislators’ preferences do not overlap and suppose a reform is introduced to favor moderate candidates over extreme candidates. \\(A\\) loses their election to a candidate with \\(B\\)’s issue preferences. Assuming \\(C\\) retains veto power, the reform has done little to ameliorate gridlock—there is no more overlap between \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) than between \\(A\\) and \\(C\\). The means may be closer, but they still do not agree on any single issue.\nThis is not to say that reforms cannot reduce gridlock, only to illustrate that a reduction in polarization does not guarantee a reduction in harm resulting from polarization. Scholars should consider not just “mean ideology” but the shape of actors’ preference distributions. In a legislature populated by less ideological voters (who have much more variable ideological preferences) as depicted in Figure 2, a reform that removed \\(A\\) or \\(C\\) would indeed be likely to reduce gridlock, though the legislators’ mean ideology are identical to those in Figure 1 each distribution is much wider. If scholars focus narrowly on mean preferences or other convenient, single-value descriptions of ideology (like self-placements or NOMINATE scores) there is no way to know if our world more closely resembles Figure 1 or Figure 2.\n\rFigure 2\rThe volume of polarization-centric work has the potential to induce myopia in social scientists, causing them to overestimate the importance and centrality of polarization as a sinister independent variable from which follows so many political ills. Polarization may be a fundamental problem of American politics, or it may just be the subfield in which the most researchers look for problems. In centering polarization and treating it as a first-order normative concern, researchers may overlook or obfuscate other problems in our politics. Even if advantaging PACs would reduce polarization, it does not follow that such a reform would improve the political climate of the U.S.—to say nothing of the material outcomes produced by our political system.\n\r","date":1614038400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614120848,"objectID":"a9fdaa702aa2cf928fb94e742d97c440","permalink":"/post/please-i-m-begging-you-mdash-stop-trying-to-solve-polarization/","publishdate":"2021-02-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/please-i-m-begging-you-mdash-stop-trying-to-solve-polarization/","section":"post","summary":"Few topics are as often abused by pundits and political scientists as ideology—particularly as it relates to partisan polarization.

This week, Governor Ron DeSantis performed an impressive rhetorical trick, abdicating not just his own responsibility for the death and illness—but that of all the wealthy consumers and business owners agitating for a return to normalcy at the expense of workers' lives.\nDesantis says \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not shutting down. We\u0026rsquo;re going to go forward. We\u0026rsquo;re not rolling back. You have to have society function\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;The disease burden is not as significant as it was in March and April,\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s “Very important to point out. We’re in a much better position than we were in March or April.”. According to DeSantis, to \u0026ldquo;shut down\u0026rdquo; (institute necessary and reasonable public health protections) the state now would do more harm to the people of Florida than the Coronavirus.\nHere, I take DeSantis at his word. I think he is entirely correct that under his administration reinstating necessary physical distance and stay-at-home orders would be terrible for the median Floridian, but this is entirely by design. In the absence of a robust state or federal response, the second round of layoffs and furloughs would be financially ruinous for hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of Floridians, but this is a false dichotomy. DeSantis would have you believe that the paths forward are predetermined: either we can plunge the state and country into depression, or we can grease the gears of the economy with the infected sputum of the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society. DeSantis, like so many leaders, loathes using the power of the state to protect its people and is too craven to tell them as much. While countries like Canada deploy their modest social safety nets to ameliorate the economic costs of prudent health policy, executives and legislators in the U.S. refuse to acknowledge that they too could create such a net.\nDeSantis, like so many elected officials who strip state healthcare funding or tell the elderly it\u0026rsquo;s their patriotic duty to sacrifice themselves for the economy, knows that it\u0026rsquo;s smart politics to collapse the range of choices presented to the public to \u0026ldquo;definitely lose your job\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;possibly get COVID-19\u0026rdquo;. Republicans recognize that the vulnerable who are hurt by their policies (or lack thereof) were likely not going to vote for them anyway and it\u0026rsquo;s safe for Democrats to hew to a similar line because as long as there are sociopaths like Dan Patrick on the right, even Cuomo-style Democrats will always be the obvious lesser-of-two-evils choice.\nThis week, Desantis took the all too common responsibility-disappearing act to a new level—not only refusing to keep people safe but placing the blame for the consequences of his inaction on those most hurt by it, blaming \u0026ldquo;overwhelmingly Hispanic farmworkers\u0026rdquo; for the rise in cases. Nevermind that the Governor\u0026rsquo;s statement is factually incorrect in the mind palaces of many of our leaders, a callous reopening is the only rational choice path forward. Because reopening is inevitable—the only alternative to economic ruin—business owners and consumers can\u0026rsquo;t be blamed for a spike in deaths and cases, after all, they have no moral agency; they are just along for the ride. Not content to cushion the economy\u0026rsquo;s crash with the bodies of workers, those in power now vilify the workers for the crash in the first place.\nThe American state is as vast as the expectations for what it can offer its people in times of crisis are minuscule. Far from offering carrots to incentivize Floridians to stay home and stay safe, DeSantis is reluctant to even brandish a stick at business owners, saying that enforcement of disease-prevention regulations would be \u0026ldquo;problematic for a whole host of reasons\u0026hellip; I think we\u0026rsquo;ve just got to trust people, give them opportunity to do good things, make good decisions. I think that works better\u0026rdquo;. Meanwhile, Medecins Sans Frontieres has opened a mission in Florida, providing care and testing to those feeding Florida while the governor sneers at them and dogwhistles to his supporters.\n","date":1592784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592844478,"objectID":"b0e272576199fc86d3193e458b370584","permalink":"/post/banality-of-desantis/","publishdate":"2020-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/banality-of-desantis/","section":"post","summary":"Ron DeSantis speaking in 2017 | photo by Gage Skidmore   In a painfully predictable turn of events, COVID-19 cases have begun to skyrocket in Florida, a few short weeks after state and local government began the process of (prematurely) rolling back public health safeguards.","tags":["politics","Ron DeSantis","Florida Politics","Coronavirus","COVID-19","State Politics","Governor","Florida"],"title":"Vilifying the Victims of an Ineffectual State","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["political science","public opinion","ANES","R"],"content":"The American National Election Study (ANES) is one of the longest running survey datasets, stretching back to 1948—offering public opinion researchers excellent continuity over a broad base of questions. ANES data is hosted either as individual survey years, or in the \u0026ldquo;cumulative data file\u0026rdquo; (CDF), which coalesces each biennial (or quadrennial) iteration of the survey into a single dataset.\nThe ANES-CDF certainly hews closer to the ideal of tidy data than some canned datasets but is not without its share of eccentricities. I\u0026rsquo;m cataloging some of the (occasionally baffling) coding choices made by the ANES here, in the hopes that it might save some other public opinion researcher\u0026mdash;especialy a hapless grad student\u0026mdash;a few minutes hours of headache down the road.\nThe CDF does not include every question from the individual surveys. This is not so much a mistake on the part of the ANES, but isn\u0026rsquo;t immediately apparent. The cumulative data file does not contain an exhaustive collection of all of the questions asked by the ANES each year. I\u0026rsquo;m currently working on a project involving within-party divisions, and wanted information about primary vote-choice. Thinking I was clever, I opened the cdf codebook and tried (to no avail) to find a question asking for whom respondents voted for in presidential primaries. Broken, defeated, and wondering why the ANES wouldn\u0026rsquo;t ask such an obvious question; I wearily turned to Google where I stumbled across the ANES Continuity Guide. Using the surprisingly well designed tool, I discovered that the question I was hoping to find was asked by the ANES occasionally, but for what I\u0026rsquo;m sure is a very good reason is excluded from the CDF (please version control the CDF).\nIf the variable you want to pull isn\u0026rsquo;t in the CDF, still take the time to look through the continuity guide. The ANES may have what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to stitch together a few different files.\nThe codebook seems to be wrong about NA values. According to the ANES-CDF codebook, NA values are given a numeric code. For example, the codebook tells us that the 7-point party ID variable is coded such that 0 indicates NA and INAP indicates that the question was not asked. Similarly, the codebook says that feeling thermometers are coded such that 98 and 99 indicate Don't Know and NA respectively, while -8 and -9 represent Don't Know and NA for VCF9255 (satisfaction with democracy).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s not rely on the codebook. Using Rcode, I\u0026rsquo;ll pull a few variables to check how they\u0026rsquo;re coded:\n# pulling anes-cdf from a GitHub repository\rcdf \u0026lt;- rio::import(\u0026quot;https://github.com/RobLytle/intra-party-affect/raw/master/data/raw/cdf-raw-trim.rds\u0026quot;)%\u0026gt;%\rselect(VCF0004, #year\rVCF0218, #Democrat FT\rVCF0224, #Republican FT\rVCF0301, #Party ID\rVCF9255, #Satisfied/not with Democracy\r#education 7cat\r)%\u0026gt;%\rrename(year = VCF0004, #renaming variables\rft_dem = VCF0218,\rft_rep = VCF0224,\rpid_7 = VCF0301,\rdemoc_satis = VCF9255,\r)%\u0026gt;%\rfilter(year \u0026gt;= 2004)%\u0026gt;% # democ_satis isn't asked until 2004, so I'm trimming the data for ease of illustration\rglimpse()\r ## Rows: 13,718\r## Columns: 5\r## $ year \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 2004, 2004, 2004, 2004, 2004, 2004, 2004, 2004, 2004, 2...\r## $ ft_dem \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; NA, 85, 15, 50, 30, 30, 30, 70, 50, 15, 85, 60, 70, 40,...\r## $ ft_rep \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; NA, 40, 85, 97, 85, 30, 60, 50, 30, 97, 60, 60, 50, 60,...\r## $ pid_7 \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 4, 3, 7, 4, 7, 4, 7, 2, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 4...\r## $ democ_satis \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 2, 1, 2, NA, 1, 3, 1, 1, NA, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, NA, 1...\r Just by tidyverse::glimpse()ing the data, we can tell that there are, in fact, NA values, contrary to what the codebook says, but let\u0026rsquo;s be certain.

It seems as though they were switched to NA when the dataset was prepared.\nSome responses are truncated. Feeling thermometer questions ask respondents to rate their warmth towards a group (like \u0026ldquo;Democrats\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Catholics\u0026rdquo;) on a scale from 0–100. As seen above though, the ANES feeling thermometer variables max out at 97. 98 and 99 are (supposedly) reserved for NA/Don't Know—though that convention is not currently in use. Likely this was done to save space and avoid 3-digit numbers. Size may have been a valid concern in a time before several-terabyte harddrives were commonplace, but serves no purpose now.\nFrom the researcher\u0026rsquo;s perspective, this truncation is troublesome, but not disastrous. Net group affect—a common measure of polarization (e.g., Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012)—is measured as \\(FT_{in} - FT_{out}\\). Since the ANES coding scheme essentially subtracts 3 from a sizeable chunk of respondents' in-party scores (notice how many 97s there are relative to other high-end responses) studies that use net group affect or something similar are likely to underestimate the degree of polarization—albeit by a small degree.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t the only instances of truncation or a misleading codebook entry, here is an example of a variable in which the variable\u0026rsquo;s levels varied year to year—not noted in its codebook entry.\nTakeaways The lesson here is to always validate for yourself what is claimed by a dataset\u0026rsquo;s documentation. These problems usually are not deadly, just easily missed. Implementing some kind of version control on the CDF would presumably make it easier to improve the dataset and fix these headaches without breaking existing scripts/analyses.\n","date":1592524800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592524800,"objectID":"4ea79032cd4a21c5b1e385bf9f2125ae","permalink":"/post/anes-problems/","publishdate":"2020-06-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/anes-problems/","section":"post","summary":"The American National Election Study (ANES) is one of the longest running survey datasets, stretching back to 1948—offering public opinion researchers excellent continuity over a broad base of questions.
